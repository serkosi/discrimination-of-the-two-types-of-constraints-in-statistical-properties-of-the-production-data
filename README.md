# Discrimination of the Two Types of Constraints in Statistical Properties of Production Data

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing how different types of constraints—technology-driven and load-driven—shape the statistical properties of industrial production data. Using large-scale datasets from steel manufacturing, the project combines empirical data analysis, network science, and theoretical modeling to uncover the mechanisms behind observed production patterns.

## Key Features
- **Network Analysis:** Construction and analysis of association networks to reveal how constraints affect connectivity, modularity, and diversity in production systems.
- **Time Window Studies:** Systematic investigation of constraint impacts across various time windows, including sliding and fixed intervals, to capture dynamic changes in production behavior.
- **Operations Research Modeling:** Integration of OR methods to simulate and compare the effects of different constraint types on production outcomes.
- **Diversity Metrics:** Quantitative assessment of product diversity and richness, with visualizations and statistical summaries.
- **Algorithmic Tools:** Modular code packages for data cleaning, network construction, and statistical analysis, enabling reproducible and extensible research.
- **Reporting and Visualization:** Automated generation of figures, tables, and summary reports to support scientific communication and decision-making.

## Impact
The project advances understanding of how constraints drive statistical regularities in industrial data, providing actionable insights for process optimization, technology selection, and production planning. The methods and tools developed here are applicable to a wide range of manufacturing domains beyond steel production.

## Abstract
Constraints lead to statistical patterns in data. This work quantifies the characteristics of two hypothetical types of constraints in industrial production: technology-driven and load-driven constraints. By analyzing the statistical properties of association networks over time in large datasets from steel manufacturing, and developing an abstract theoretical framework, the project clarifies the connection between each type of constraint and its statistical patterns.
